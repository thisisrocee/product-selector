# Product Variation Selector

This code provides an implementation of a product selection form with variations. The form allows users to select a product from a list and choose associated variations, resulting in a composed product code. The code is written in React and utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling. The project was set up using Vite.

## Features

- **The Component** reads the product and variation data from the provided JSON file.
- **Initially**, no product or variations are selected.
- **When a product** is selected, the associated variations are displayed as additional menus.
- **Users can select** the desired options for each variation.
- **Once all variations** are selected, the combined product code is displayed.

## How to Run

To use this code in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init
    
2. Use this command to see the code in your web browser:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    
That's it! You should now have the Product Variation Selector page up and running on your local machine.

**If there is error then usually the issue disapears when VS Code is restarted ;)**
